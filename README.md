# The Legend of Zelda: A Basic Python Game

## Introduction

This is a basic python game created using python. Play as the hero Link
in his quest to defeat the evil Gannon. The Zelda franchise is one of
Nintendo's most well known and beloved franchises. It has spawned
countless games spanning back to 1987's The Legend of Zelda and more
recently the critically acclaimed The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the
Wild.

I built this game as a way to
learn more about the practical use of python by following
